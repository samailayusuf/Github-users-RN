# Github-users-RN

- This is a react native application that displays list of cards containing Github users in a city.
- You supply programming language and city and the app fetches github users for that programming language, and in that city.
- You can share the profile of a selected Github user through your desired social media apps, or visit the user's Github profile from the card.
- In the project I've used. FontAwesome, React-Native/Expo, React Navigation, and Axios.

To run the project, clone to your local machine. and run the command `npm install`, `expo start` will run the project in either you emulator, physical device, or web (choose any comfortable to you)

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any suggestions for me.
